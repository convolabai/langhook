- ✅ Complete CRUD lifecycle testing

**Event Ingestion (8 tests):**
- ✅ GitHub webhook events
- ✅ Stripe webhook events
- ✅ Custom source events
- ✅ Invalid JSON handling
- ✅ Large payload handling
- ✅ Health checks and metrics

**Event Processing Flow (4 tests):**
- ✅ Complete GitHub PR event processing
- ✅ Event flow with subscription matching
- ✅ Multiple source event processing
- ✅ System resilience testing

**Service Integration (2 tests):**
- ✅ Multi-service health validation
- ✅ End-to-end integration testing

**Connectivity (2 tests):**
- ✅ Basic Docker environment verification
- ✅ API connectivity testing

## 🏗️ Infrastructure Components

**Docker Compose Setup:**
- `docker-compose.test.yml` - Test environment configuration
- Faster health checks for CI/CD
- Test-specific environment variables
- Service isolation and cleanup

**Test Utilities:**
- `E2ETestUtils` class for common operations
- Automatic setup/teardown with data cleanup
- Multi-service client management (HTTP, NATS, Redis, PostgreSQL)
- Event processing validation helpers

**CI/CD Pipeline:**
- GitHub Actions workflow with 4 jobs:
  1. Unit tests
  2. End-to-end tests  
  3. Linting and type checking
  4. Security scanning
- Automatic execution on PRs and pushes
- Docker layer caching for performance
- Comprehensive logging on failures

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

**Local Development:**
```bash
# Quick start - run all E2E tests
./scripts/run-e2e-tests.sh

# Manual Docker testing
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d --build
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.test.yml run --rm test-runner

# Run specific test categories
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.test.yml run --rm test-runner \
  python -m pytest tests/e2e/test_subscriptions_crud.py -v
```

**CI/CD Integration:**
- Tests run automatically on every PR
- Must pass before merge
- Includes unit tests, e2e tests, linting, and security scans

## 🔧 Technical Details

**Test Environment:**
- Uses Docker Compose for service orchestration
- Isolated test database with automatic cleanup
- NATS messaging for event processing
- Redis for rate limiting
- All services with health checks

**Test Isolation:**
- Each test run starts with clean environment
- Test data cleanup between tests
- No interference between test runs
- Proper async/await handling for all operations

**Error Handling:**
- Graceful handling of service unavailability
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Timeout handling for long-running operations
- Service health monitoring

## ✅ Quality Assurance

**Code Quality:**
- All existing tests (23) continue to pass
- New tests follow existing patterns and conventions
- Comprehensive error handling and edge cases
- Clear, descriptive test names and documentation

**Performance:**
- Optimized Docker health check intervals for faster startup
- Efficient test data cleanup
- Parallel test execution where possible
- Docker layer caching in CI/CD

**Maintainability:**
- Well-structured utility classes
- Consistent test patterns
- Comprehensive documentation
- Easy to extend for new APIs or services

## 🎉 Ready for Production

The end-to-end test suite is now complete and ready for use. It provides:

1. **Comprehensive Coverage** - All major APIs and workflows tested
2. **Easy Local Testing** - Simple script-based execution
3. **CI/CD Integration** - Automated testing on every code change
4. **Production Ready** - Robust error handling and service integration
